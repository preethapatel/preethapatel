### Hi! :) 👋
My name is Preetha and I'm a college student with an interest in Data and Business Analytics! On the side of school, I have been working on gaining skills in Excel, SQL, STATA, Tableau, and Python, and am currently working on various projects to depthen my interest by trying/making more complex dashboards as well as see how to derive meaningful results from data! Here is a little bit about myself...

- 👩🏻‍💻 Current Project: A Customer Marketing Campaign Analysis project where I am cleaning a large csv file and will develop an Excel Dashboard to gain insights on how effective the campaign is on profits
- 🌱 Currently learning: how to pull data and perform analysis through coding!
- 📚 Favorite Subjects: Calculus and Statistics (anything with numbers LOL) 
- 💭 Hobbies: I looooove to game on my switch, workout, travel around California on my weekends, and partake in various outdoor excursions 
- 💻 Current binge: King of the Hill
- Fun Fact: Everything about the ocean freaks me out ._. 🌊
